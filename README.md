# A rust wrapper for HIP.

> The Heterogeneous-computing Interface for Portability (HIP) API is a C++ runtime API and kernel language that lets developers create portable applications running in heterogeneous systems, using CPUs and AMD GPUs or NVIDIA GPUs from a single source code. HIP provides a simple marshalling language to access either the AMD ROCM back-end, or NVIDIA CUDA back-end, to build and run application kernels.
